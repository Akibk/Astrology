	Have you ever been watching a celebrity and felt an inexplicable connection? Something deep and meaningful while simultaneously not threatening to your partner?
	</p>
	<p>
	Have the naysayers and the doubters held you back? Do they tell you it's just a celebrity crush? Do they deny the real connections humans must all have with the universe?
	</p>
	<p>
	After all, science has shown that everything vibrates you probably heard that vibrations can resonate which means it sounds about right that you can resonate with the universe.

	Classical astrology separates people into "star signs". This ancient technology understood the vital connection between some things you can see in the night sky, the location of the earth's orbit around the sun when you were born, and whether your crush will finally take a hint you're not asking him out for coffee for the coffee.

	<p>
	Recent advances in astrology research have unearthed hitherto undiscovered star signs borrowing from neo-jungian personality type theory in psychoanalysis. It turns out if you keep adding new categories and moving the boundaries, there is enough ambiguity to look like you match experimental statistics and can technically be called a science.

	<p>
	This science is known as Quantum Astrology. Using these revolutionary techniques, astrologers can now pinpoint your exact vibrational mode individually tailored to you. No longer do we need birth dates to see if you will pass university exams. Instead we require one tiny bit of information specific to only you.As you'll see later in the quiz.
